This is a project that I worked on early-2016. I was originally brought on to add some new pages and update some current ones. Though the website was a Wordpress Theme, it wasn't actually dynamic; none of the content could be changed. I suggested letting me rebuild the entire site from scratch and making it into a custom, fully dynamic theme, to which they agreed. I made it as simple as possible to update the site, through the use of Advanced Custom Fields and Custom Post Types. They were impressed with the final site.

"We hired on Alex to upgrade my companyâ€™s website. After going though many opinions, we decided to have the entire site recoded. During the process he successfully entertained all of our many different ideas and style changes until we decided on what we wanted it to look like. He was great at keeping us up to date on the project. After the site went up, he took extra time to teach and train an employee how to update and manage the site properly. The website looks amazing! It was truly a pleasure to work with him."
